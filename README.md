# Reproducible research in R
Code used in my presentation on reproducible research in R during the the Lenhard group lab retreat in Dubrovnik, October 2015.

Slides available [on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/liz__is/reproducible-research-and-literate-programming-in-r).

The example code is a modified version of the vignette for the *GenomicInteractions* Bioconductor package, which can be downloaded [here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicInteractions/).
